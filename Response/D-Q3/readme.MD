## More than one adversarial patch in the image

There are four adversarial examples with multi-patch attacks.

Among these four sets of examples, both Canary and Woodpecker defenses successfully detect the adversarial patch attacks.

Shown in the image "000377_adv.jpg", there are eight people present in the image, with 8 adversarial patches introduced, resulting in three individuals being hidden.

Show in the image "000377_canary.jpg," we introduced two Canary Patches. Both Canary Patches failed to be correctly recognized, leading to the detection of adversarial patch attacks.

Show in the image "000377_cwoodpecker.jpg," we introduced two Woodpecker Patches. Two individuals were newly detected, which also led to the detection of adversarial patch attacks.
